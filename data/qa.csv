how do I start investing ~ First, determine what you want to achieve with your investing, whether it's in the short-term or long-term. If you’re saving for retirement, for instance, you may choose to invest in a target-date fund, a type of mutual fund that automatically adjusts your investment mix based on your age and how soon you’d like to retire. If you want to be more hands-on, then you’d probably have to do more research on the types of investments that make sense for your timeline and risk tolerance, and consider rebalancing your portfolio as time goes by.
what type of investments are available to the average person ~ Stocks are probably the most well-known option, but picking and choosing individual companies to invest in is not how most people get involved in the market. Instead, you might want to consider an index fund, which invests in the securities included in indexes like the S&P 500.
is it risky to pick out your own stocks ~ Studies show that choosing stocks is almost always a losing proposition—even for the pros. Plus, the more you trade stocks, the more likely you are to incur trading fees, which eats into any money you’d make.
why is risk tolerance important ~ Risk tolerance comes down to how much risk you are willing and able to stomach, and it’s important to know because it can impact how you shape your portfolio. Winkler suggests a simple gut check: “If you’re up [at night] thinking about your investments and fearing that a down market may bring your portfolio down too much, then you may be carrying too much risk,” he says. On the flip side, if you’re worried that you could be missing out on earning potential, your investments might be too conservative.
why is it crucial to be diversified ~ It’s important to consider not only being invested in different sectors of the economy, but also investing in a mix of stocks and bonds. Index funds are one way you might further diversify your portfolio because they can track both stock and bond indexes. Bottom line: The broader your portfolio is, the likelier you are to weather a market storm.
what type of retirement account should I have ~ This will depend entirely on your investing goals, income level, employment status and tax situation. But consider opening a retirement account as your first order of business because retirement savings is generally described as one of the pillars of financial security. And if your employer matches contributions to a 401(k), be sure to take advantage of that match—it’s essentially free money! If your company doesn’t offer this perk, you may want to consider a traditional or Roth IRA.
how can investing affect my taxes ~ If you’re investing in a taxable brokerage account, you usually won’t get tax breaks, and you’ll pay taxes on your earnings anytime you sell a holding, known as capital gains. And as an incentive to invest for the long haul, the government also charges a higher tax rate on earnings from investments you hold for less than a year, called short-term capital gains.
why should I prioritize retirement over non-retirement investing ~ Given the modern life span, you could expect to live about 30 years as a retired person. Think about your expenses each year, multiply that by decades—and you’ll start to conceptualize just what a tremendous savings goal retirement is.
how often should I check my portfolio ~ The key is not to move your investments on a whim just because you see a drop in the stock market or hear that the S&P 500 hit a new record. A good rule of thumb is to consider rebalancing once a year to help ensure that your asset allocation (the percentage of your money dedicated to various types of assets) has not strayed too far from what you’re comfortable with, and if your portfolio is more than 5% off from your model asset allocation, think about making some adjustments.
