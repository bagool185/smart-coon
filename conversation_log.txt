user-prompt>hi

bot: Hello! How are you?

user-prompt> I am pretty alright

bot: That's good to know. What would you like to discuss about?

user-prompt> how does one start investing

bot: First, determine what you want to achieve with your investing, whether it's in the short-term or long-term. If you’re saving for retirement, for instance, you may choose to invest in a target-date fund, a type of mutual fund that automatically adjusts your investment mix based on your age and how soon you’d like to retire. If you want to be more hands-on, then you’d probably have to do more research on the types of investments that make sense for your timeline and risk tolerance, and consider rebalancing your portfolio as time goes by.

user-prompt> what is a mutual fund

bot: A mutual fund is an open-end professionally managed investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities. Mutual funds are "the largest proportion of equity of U.S. corporations." Mutual fund investors may be retail or institutional in nature. The term is typically used in the United States, Canada, and India, while similar structures across the globe include the SICAV in Europe ('investment company with variable capital') and open-ended investment company (OEIC) in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                              Mutual funds have advantages and disadvantages compared to direct investing in individual securities.

user-prompt> speaking of individual securities, is risk tolerance important?

bot: Risk tolerance comes down to how much risk you are willing and able to stomach, and it’s important to know because it can impact how you shape your portfolio. Winkler suggests a simple gut check: “If you’re up [at night] thinking about your investments and fearing that a down market may bring your portfolio down too much, then you may be carrying too much risk,” he says. On the flip side, if you’re worried that you could be missing out on earning potential, your investments might be too conservative.

user-prompt> is it risky picking your own stocks?

bot: Studies show that choosing stocks is almost always a losing proposition—even for the pros. Plus, the more you trade stocks, the more likely you are to incur trading fees, which eats into any money you’d make.
